Credit where it's due,
<a href="https://github.com/Picoseconds/sanctuary">Sanctuary</a> for some item ids,
as well as <a href="https://github.com/Illya9999/OasisProject">For a list of packets</a>,
and of course whoever decided it would be a good idea to leave the non-minified version of moomoo's bundle on dev.moomoo.io for a short time.
